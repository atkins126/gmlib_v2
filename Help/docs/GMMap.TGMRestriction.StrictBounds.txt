Bounds can be made more restrictive by setting the strictBounds flag to true. This reduces how far a user can zoom out, ensuring that everything outside of the restricted bounds stays hidden. The default is false, meaning that a user can zoom out until the entire bounded area is in view, possibly including areas outside the bounded area.
