This setting controls how the API handles gestures on the map. Allowed values:

"cooperative": Scroll events and one-finger touch gestures scroll the page, and do not zoom or pan the map. Two-finger touch gestures pan and zoom the map. Scroll events with a ctrl key or key pressed zoom the map.
In this mode the map cooperates with the page.
"greedy": All touch gestures and scroll events pan or zoom the map.
"none": The map cannot be panned or zoomed by user gestures.
"auto": (default) Gesture handling is either cooperative or greedy, depending on whether the page is scrollable or in an iframe.
