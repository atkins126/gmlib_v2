@abstract(When you load the Maps JavaScript API from maps.googleapis.com it applies a default bias for application behavior towards the United States.)

If you want to alter your application to serve different map tiles or bias the application (such as biasing geocoding results towards the region), you can override this default behavior by adding a region.
